# 🧭 AI Travel Buddy

An interactive AI app that creates **quirky or conventional travel itineraries** in seconds.  
Built with **Gradio + OpenAI API**, deployed on Hugging Face Spaces for an always-on live demo.  

## ✨ Features
- Personalize by **destination, days, vibe, pace, companions, dietary needs**
- Dial **Quirkiness** slider → from safe & conventional → to offbeat & unusual
- **Presets** for quick demos (Tokyo foodie, Lisbon outdoors, NYC culture)
- **Markdown itinerary export** for easy sharing
- Powered by **OpenAI models** (customizable)

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Scroll down to the interactive demo below 👇
2. Enter a destination, set preferences (budget, pace, vibe)
3. Adjust **quirkiness** slider to your taste
4. Click **✨ Generate Itinerary** to get a day-by-day plan
5. (Optional) Export as Markdown for saving or sharing

## 🎯 Why I Built This
Travel planning can be overwhelming.  
**AI Travel Buddy** makes it fun and interactive:
- A serious demo of AI + product skills
- A quirky side project that recruiters and interviewers can try themselves
- Deployed end-to-end: from prompt design → app UI → cloud hosting

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) → low-code interactive UI
- [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/) → itinerary generation
- [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) → free public hosting
- Secrets management → keeps API key safe (not in code)

## 📌 Notes
- This app **suggests itineraries**, it does **not** book travel or fetch real-time prices.
- Results may vary depending on the model/temperature set.
